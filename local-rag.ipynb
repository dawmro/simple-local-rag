The Human Life Cycle  Human bodies change significantly over time, and food is the fuel  for those changes. For example, for Native Hawaiians, expecting  mothers were encouraged to eat greens like the lu‘au (young taro  leaves) and palula (young sweet potato leaves) to encourage a  healthy, strong baby.  These beliefs and customs practiced in the  early stages of life were done in hopes of building a firm foundation  and setting up lifelong health.1  People of all ages need the same basic nutrients—essential amino  acids, carbohydrates, essential fatty acids, and twenty-eight  vitamins and minerals—to sustain life and health. However, the  amounts of nutrients needed differ. Throughout the human life  cycle, the body constantly changes and goes through different  periods known as stages. This chapter will focus on pregnancy,  1. Pukai MK.,  Handy ESC. (1958). The Polynesian Family  System in Ka-‘u. Rutland, Vermont: Charles E. Tuttle  Company  780  |  Introduction'},\n",

This is a vast  and never-ending task, given the large number of essential human  nutrients. These nutrients include protein, energy, carbohydrates,  fats and lipids, a range of vitamins, and a host of minerals and trace  elements.  Many countries rely on WHO and FAO to establish and  disseminate this information, which they adopt as part of their  national dietary allowances. Others use it as a base for their  standards. The establishment of human nutrient requirements is the  common foundation for all countries to develop food-based dietary  guidelines for their populations.  Establishing requirements means that the public health and  clinical significance of intake levels – both deficiency and excess  – and associated disease patterns for each nutrient, need to be  thoroughly reviewed for all age groups.

In the liver, carotenoids are repackaged into lipoproteins, which transport them to cells. The retinoids are aptly named as their most notable function is in the retina of the eye where they aid in vision, particularly in seeing under low-light conditions. This is why night blindness is the most definitive sign of vitamin A deficiency. Vitamin A has several important functions in the body, including maintaining vision and a healthy immune system. Many of vitamin A’s functions in the body are similar to the functions of hormones (for example, vitamin A can interact with DNA, causing a change in protein function). Vitamin A assists in maintaining healthy skin and the linings and coverings of tissues; it also regulates growth and development. As an antioxidant, vitamin A protects cellular membranes, helps in maintaining glutathione levels, and influences the amount and activity of enzymes that detoxify free radicals. Vision Retinol that is circulating in the blood is taken up by cells in the eye retina, where it is converted to retinal and is used to help the pigment rhodopsin, which is involved in the eye’s ability to see under low light conditions. A deficiency in vitamin A thus results in less rhodopsin and a decrease in the detection of low-level light, a condition referred to as night-blindness.',\n",
